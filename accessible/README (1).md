<h1>Work in Progress</h1>
current live site:
https://andrew-jn-west.github.io/A11y-test-Discover-Neptune/

---

This site was made with AI, for the sole purpose of N Squared LLC to test whether or not an AI model developed to create websites, can make them accessible by implementing WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA, ADA, and Section 508 standards.

---

1.5 out of 5. It did not do much else except poor alt attributes, and same-page links functioning correctly.

---

The site was re-worked to not only make changes due to possible legal risks from the content the AI had used, but also to improve the overall content and make it more relevant, as well as more accessible for users.

Any images within this website are either credited below in the footer, or were made with AI image generation in order to make practice development possible.

---

This project has shared ownership between the developer who made it (me), and N Squared LLC, for the purposes of Demonstration of implementing core accessibility, as well as being portfolio work.
